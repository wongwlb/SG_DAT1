# Week 2 Lecture - Machine Learning

Model split into: Training Set -> Test

Maching learning training set:
80% negative-20% positive is the stereotypical rule (e.g. Not face vs Face)

Supervised learning - Making predictions (generalization)
	Accurately predict unseen test cases
	Understand which predictors affect the response, and how
	Asses the quality of our predictions

Unsupervised learning - Extracting structures (representation)
	No response variable y, just a set of predictors X
	Find groups of observations that behave similarly

Vector(list) of "predictors": X
"response": Y
If y is continuous: REGRESSION
If y is categorical: CLASSIFICATION
